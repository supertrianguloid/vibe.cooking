Make a kind of tofu with Lentils, or other legums.

## Steps

1. soak lentils for a day in triple the volume of water

2. drain the lentils and wash

3. blend the lentils with water until very fine, add salt and flavours.
Lemon, ginger and oregano are a good combination hear.

4. cook liquid on hob until boiling, stir continually else it will stick

5. turn hob to low, stir continually for 20 minutes until becomes a past

6. turn paste into container for setting, place in fridge for 15 minutes

7. once paste is set it is now tofu, turn out onto a chopping board. If not set cook again.

9. cut the tofu into cubes and fry with oil giving each cube enough space.
The oil will make the tofu go soft, if they are too close, they will bind together.
