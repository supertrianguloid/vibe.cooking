- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4 People

 
## Ingredients

- Strong Baeking Flower (30 g)
- Fast Acting Yeast (2 tsp)
- Salt (2tsp)
- Water (30 g)

## Directions
1. Mix
 1. First mix the Salt into the flower
 2. Then mix the Yeast in, if this is done in the wrong order, the salt may kill the yeast.
2. Need
 1. Ster the water in bit by bit untill the doe is wet
 2. Start mixing in bowl untill the doe starts to gain a coherence, and can be worked as a ball
 3. Sprinkel work serfice with flower, and start to work the doe on the curfice. The consept is that your developing glutin fibers, so think of the doe as a ball of glupy string. Your trying to tangle the string.
 4. Once the doe is getting near the end start Shapeing the doe. By this point you should be able to smell the Yeast activating, it should not take  more then 15 minutes, If your still there in 20 minutes, then something has gone wrong, move on with what you got.
3. Rise
 1. sprinkel bakeing tray with flower and place doe
 2. Cover with a teatowl
 3. Leave to Rise for 10 to 20 minutes
 4. Make sure the overn is at 200C by the end of the Raising time
4. Cut
 1. Take the teatowl off the bread
 2. Use a razer blade or other sharp instrement to cut releave lines in the dow.
 3. This will help the bread expand in the right way whilst in the overn
5. Bake
 1. Place the 30 mintues
 2. For the first 10 mintues or so, the bread will go through a period in which the yeast become super active due to the heat, this is called the bounce for obvouse resons. During this time the bread should expand the cuts you made in the previouse step.
 3. After the bounce the bread will continue to cook, once the bread looks cooked from the out side (is lightly brown) you may want to check on the bread
 4. Open the overn and pull the tray out a little bit. Turn the bread over and tap it with your knuckles, If the bread sounds wet and dense then its still got cooking to do. If it sounds dry and hollow, then it Done!

## Trouble Shooting
- If the Bread just tasts kind os hard to eat and dull, its probably because you needed to add mroe salt. You might not think bread is a salty food, but you really miss the salt when its not there
- If the Bread didnt rise, the problem is probably with the yeast, perhaps it didnt have long enugh to rise, or perhaps it was left out for too long and the yeast died.
- If there are large air pockets of your bread slumped then the problem is with the glutin fibers. If your flower had a low glutin content then it can be harder to develop good fibers, and even with a high content, developing fibers takes a lot of elbow gress. You really have to beat up that bread.

## Storage
The Bread will last a few days, if the inside is keeped away from air. 
Once cut, leave the bread, cut side down on a choppig board, or else in a bread bag.
Bread going stail is no health hazard, and you can bake it in the overn to turn it into breadcrumbs, or mixit into soup as a thickener.

The bread is only going to be bad for you if it goes moldy, ive only ever had shop bort bread go moldy. Probably something to do with condensation and the plastic bag.


## Nutrition
The only nutritionaly sugnificant content of the bread is the flower, so check that for the specific numbers but as a rule of thumb ...
- Protein:  10 % by mass (supprisingly good)
- Carbohydrate: 90 %
